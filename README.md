# The Orbitron Arena Website Project

Welcome to the website for The Orbitron Arena, an elite venue specializing in concerts, EDM festivals, international performance acts, and exclusive private events.
This project features a multi-page site developed with HTML5 and CSS3, designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Key Features
- **Home Page**: Features a striking hero banner, a welcoming introduction, and an “About Us” section with a direct link to explore upcoming events.
- **Events Page**: Showcases three upcoming events, each with titles, dates, descriptions, images, and featured performers, presented in a clear, structured format.
- **Menu Page**: Presents a well-organized table of food options, categorized (e.g., Appetizers, Mains, Desserts), with item names, prices, visually appealing striped rows, and interactive hover effects.
- **Location Page**: Provides detailed location information, including address, operating hours, nearby landmarks, and an embedded Google Map for easy navigation.
- **Contact Us Page**: Offers a user-friendly form for inquiries, including fields for Name, Email, and Message, with built-in validation to ensure all required information is provided.
- **Responsive Layout**: Utilizes media queries, flexbox, and grid layouts to ensure seamless functionality and readability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a consistent navigation menu across all pages, linking to Home, Events, Menu, Location, and Contact Us, with uniform styling and hover interactions.
- **Design Elements**: Boasts a polished look with consistent red text, a sleek black navigation bar, a white footer, gray buttons, and engaging hover effects for links, buttons, and images.

## Front End UI / UX Employed
- HTML, Using semantic tags such as `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<form>`, and `<img>` with descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- CSS, utilizing basic properties like colors, margins, padding, borders, flexbox, grid, and media queries for responsive design and interactivity.

## Image Resources
- Hero banner image: `images/sphere.jpg`.
- Event images: `images/Marshmello.jpg`, `images/Atarashii_Gakko!.jpg`, `images/Lindsey_Stirling.jpg`.

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone the 'Event_Center_Website' repository to your computer.
2. Launch `index.html` in a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to explore the Home page.
3. Use the navigation bar to navigate to other pages: Events, Menu, Location, and Contact Us.

## Testing and Verification
- All navigation links were checked to ensure they function correctly (assuming files are in the same directory).
- Form validation on the Contact Us page was verified using HTML5 `required` attributes, ensuring fields are filled before submission.

## Additional Notes
- All images are hosted locally within the project for reliability and faster loading, eliminating dependence on external URLs, mainly to avoid any issues if the URL or website took the images down.
- The CSS used is basic, and beginner-friendly, focusing on fundamental properties like `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `color`, and simple layout techniques (flexbox, grid).
